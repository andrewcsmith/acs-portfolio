The Audience vs Ecstasy Mule vs John Cage vs Ecstasy Mule vs The Audience is an aleatoric construction as opposed to an indeterminate one, using elements of the John Cage compositions Indeterminacy, Music Walk, Water Walk, Variation #1, Imaginary Landscape #5 and Radio Music, as well as some other chance determined sound sourcings. It was created at the request of Miguel Fransconi for the Cage100 Festival at the Stone in September, 2012 and was subsequently performed in the RipRig Series in Philadelphia. For this performance, the entire audience will be asked to play the piece.

Check out the recording of Ecstasy Mule vs John Cage vs Ecstasy Mule from Philadelphia. The composition on February 24 will sound nothing like this.
