The Guidonian Hand Trombone Quartet and Ensemble Indexical will perform new
pieces for double quartet by composers Erik Carlson, Tyler Wilcox, and Andrew
C. Smith, with *Daniel (1)* by Craig Shepard. The new pieces have been composed
over the past months, with a workshop session for composers to try ideas and
work directly with the performers. This sustained engagement with the music
over two months allows composers to develop their new works more fully.

**The Guidonian Hand Trombone Quartet** (Mark Broschinsky, William Lang, James
Rogers, and Sebastian Vera) is Americaâ€™s leading modern trombone collective.
They have performed at the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society, Le Poisson
Rouge, The Stone, The Juilliard School, Roulette, and many other venues. The
group often collaborates with composers, and maintains a composer-in-residence
position for each season.

**Ensemble Indexical** is a flexible group that expands and contracts to fit
the requirements of each composition and its context. Its unfixed
instrumentation allows it to adapt to the program at hand. This iteration is a
string quartet with Rachel Golub & Mario Gotoh (violins), Victor Lowrie
(viola), and John Popham (cello).

This event is supported by Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish Williamsburg.
