title: "I.5: Together"
time: 2012-06-17T22:00
venue: Incubator Arts Project at St. Mark’s Church in the Bowery (131 East 10th St., NYC)

Together contains duos of identical instruments: two violins, two guitars, two snare drums. While in these pieces the two instrumentalists are often treated as a single being, a certain dialogue between them remains inevitable. The program features String Noise (violinists Conrad Harris & Pauline Kim Harris) performing Jürg Frey’s Ohne Titel (2 Violinen), Dean Rosenthal’s Perfect for String Noise, and premieres by Andrew C. Smith and Jason Brogan; and Beau Sievers & Jack Callahan performing music for snare drums by KCM Walker.
