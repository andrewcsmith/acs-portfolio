Séverine Ballon studied the cello at the Hochschule of Berlin and Lübeck with
Joseph Schwab and Troels Svane. In 2004-2005, she was academist at the Ensemble
Modern (Internationale Ensemble Modern Akademie). She perfected her
contemporary cello technique with Siegfried Palm, Pierre Strauch and Rohan de
Saram. In 2005-2006, she was solo cellist of the Toulouse Chamber Orchestra,
then decided to concentrate in contemporary music and premiering new works. In
2008-2009 she was resident artist at the Akademie Schloss Solitude (Stuttgart).

She has worked with the most renowned contemporary music ensembles: Klangforum
Wien, musikFabrik, Ensemble Intercontemporain, Ictus… She is a member of the
Elision ensemble (Australia), Multilatérale (Paris) and Ensemble Experimental
(Freiburg, Germany).

She particularly enjoys working directly with composers, such as Helmut
Lachenmann, Liza Lim, Rebecca Saunders… She has premiered solo works which have
been dedicated to her (Liza Lim, Erik Ulman, Mauro Lanza, Stefano Bulfon, Clara
Iannotta, David Coll…). She is working on developing extended techniques for
her instrument and finding an appropriate notation.

Her interest in electronic music has led her to work at the IRCAM with the
composer David Coll and Rama Gottfried, and also in close collaboration with
the studio “La Muse en Circuit” (Alfortville).

Séverine Ballon was laureate of the international competition for the
interpretation of contemporary music of Gioia del Colle (Italy) in 2004 and of
the Marie-Luise Imbusch Foundation.

Her activity as an improviser has led her to work in a duo with the electronic
artist Sébastien Roux, she has also performed with the visual artists Alexander
Schellow and Evi Keller.

In 2010 she was soloist at the Stuttgart Opera in the opera “pnima” by Chaya
Czernowin. In April 2013 she will be invited as a visiting artist at Harvard
University.
