Transient Series I.2 (Cover Bands Edition) is likely the only event to conceptually link Ke$ha and Patsy Cline. But both of these inhabitants of the Great American Songbook will coexist this evening: one cut up by R We Who R We (composer-performers Philip White & Ted Hearne) and the other very carefully notated by a computer and played by the all-human Happy Valley Band — with the ghost voice of Patsy herself. And audio-visual artist Alexander Dupuis covers cellular automata with his performance of Conway’s Game of Life.
