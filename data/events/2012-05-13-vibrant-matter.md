time: 2012-05-13T22:00
venue: Willow Place Auditorium (26 Willow Place, Brooklyn)
ticket price: no cover

The program of Vibrant Matter explores an alien world of musical material, structure, and form – a synthetic landscape of human and nonhuman agencies where, in the words of philosopher Quentin Meillassoux, “there can be no physics, but only a chronics of things.” Members of Ensemble Pamplemousse, loadbang, and the S.E.M. Ensemble perform solos by John Zorn, Marek Poliks, Jennie Gottschalk, Alvin Lucier, and Timothy McCormack, structured around a series of trio performances of Michael Pisaro’s “harmony series” compositions.

Performers are: Jason Brogan, David Broome, Jack Callahan, Natacha Diels, Pauline Kim Harris, Cat Lamb, William Lang, Jessie Marino, and Andrew C. Smith. Vibrant Matter was curated by Jason Brogan.
