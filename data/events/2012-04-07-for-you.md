The Transient Series continues with pieces performed by you, the audience. The compositions range from works for hair combs to experimental vocal rounds (think “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” as minimalist drone music) to conceptual works that challenge what it means to perform, and what it means to listen. The concert is curated by K. C. M. Walker, with a special performance by Chris Peck.

Composers: Yoko Ono, K. C. M. Walker, Manfred Werder, Chris Peck, Larry Polansky, George Brecht
