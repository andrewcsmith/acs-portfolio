We would like to invite you to a benefit concert for Index 0, the first release by the cooperatively run label Index, on February 10, 2013, at 8 pm. The record includes pieces by Elizabeth Adams, Jack Callahan, Beau Sievers, Andrew C. Smith, and K.C.M. Walker.

In August 2012, we spent two days recording material with the violin duo String Noise (Conrad Harris & Pauline Kim Harris), who were joined by Dov Scheindlin and Brian Snow for two compositions for string quartet. The entire record has since been edited and mixed, so funds raised from this concert will go directly to mastering and manufacturing costs of the 2-LP release. The record will be released as a 2-LP set, as well as a digital download.

While planning Index 0, we discussed how to sustainably fund future projects like this one. We decided we would form a cooperative for experimental musicians and composers, pooling our collective resources in support of each othersâ€™ projects. We want to ensure that Index 0 is fully funded, so we can put profits toward establishing this organization and funding its projects.

The benefit includes performances by:

String Noise 
Praxis 
The Dream Team 
Beau Sievers 
Andrew C. Smith 
With food by Beau, and beer by Andrew
