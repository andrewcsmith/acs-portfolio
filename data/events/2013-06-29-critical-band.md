Bandwidth is about sound that can be shaped, filtered, and sculpted, to create an object that is about more than just its constituent parts. The composer James Tenneyâ€™s (1934-2006) piece *Critical Band* is a prime example of this: from a simple numerical series, the piece slowly expands from a dense cluster into a consonant collection of tones. This concert presents Tenney's seminal piece alongside newer works by Anne Guthrie & Billy Gomberg, Michael Winter, John P. Hastings, Brian Parks, and Laura Steenberge.
