**Bandwidth** is about compositions that start from a single parameter or principle, extrapolating an entire piece from this one point. It is like looking through a paper towel tube, focusing on a small circle in the distance, until the outline of the tube becomes the viewer's world. These pieces begin with a mechanism—a simple numerical series, the resonance of a room, or the shape of a singer's mouth—and build into something more. They ask the listener to focus on a small space, and to find what is audible within it.

The program includes James Tenney's (1934-2006) piece *Critical Band*, where through a simple numerical series, the piece slowly expands from a dense microtonal cluster into a harmonically resonant chord. This seminal work is presented alongside world premieres by Fraufraulein (Anne Guthrie & Billy Gomberg), John P. Hastings, and Brian Parks, with less-new works by Michael Winter and Laura Steenberge.
