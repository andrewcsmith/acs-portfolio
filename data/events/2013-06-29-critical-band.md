**Bandwidth** is about sound that is filtered so that only part of the sound is audible. It is like looking through a paper towel tube, where much of the environment is blocked from view and the focus is on a single element or parameter. These pieces begin from a single mechanism—a simple numerical series, the resonance of a room, or the shape of a singer's mouth—and build a piece from this parameter. They ask the listener to focus on this small space, finding what is audible within it.

The program includes James Tenney's (1934-2006) piece *Critical Band*, a prime example of this: from a simple numerical series, the piece slowly expands from a dense microtonal cluster into a harmonically resonant chord. This seminal work is presented alongside world premieres by Fraufraulein (Anne Guthrie & Billy Gomberg), John P. Hastings, and Brian Parks, with (slightly) older works by Michael Winter and Laura Steenberge.
